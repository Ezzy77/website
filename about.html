                <p>Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones was born on September 14, 
                1973, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Nas's debut album, Illmatic, was released in 
                1994. Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, LES, and DJ Premier contributed for the production, 
                and Nas's pal AZ and his father Olu Dara made guest appearances. "The World Is Yours," "It Ain't Hard 
                to Tell", and "One Love" were among the album's hit singles. MTV News Shaheem Reid dubbed Illmatic "the first 
                classic LP" of 1994. Nas also recorded the song "One on One" for the Street Fighter soundtrack in 1994. 
                William Jelani Cobb talks on Nas's influence during the period in his book To the Break 
                of Dawn, a Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic.

                <h3>1994â€“1998: Transition to mainstream direction and the Firm</h3>
                <p>It Was Written was published in the middle of 1996. "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)" 
                    (with Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and "Street Dreams" (including R. Kelly in a remix) were both instant hits. 
                    [32] Nas became well-known among popular hip-hop fans when these tracks were pushed by big-budget music videos 
                    created by Hype Williams. Although the album's rhymes were not as intricate as those on Illmatic, Allmusic's 
                    Leo Stanley wrote in his review that Nas had "deepened his talents, generating a complicated succession of 
                    rhymes that not only flow, but manage to tell coherent stories as well." [33] The Firm, a supergroup comprised 
                    of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega, made their debut on It Was Written.

                <p>On April 10, 2013, Nas invested an undisclosed six-figure sum into Mass Appeal Magazine, where he went
                   on to serve as the publication's associate publisher, joined by creative firm Decon and White Owl Capital 
                   Partners. In June 2013, he opened his own sneaker store.
                
                    In September 2013, he invested in a technology startup company, a job search appmaker called Proven.
                    In 2014, Nas invested as part of a $2.8M round in viral video startup ViralGains another addition to 
                    Queens-bridge venture partners portfolio.
